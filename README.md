# 3D-Modeling_MyBedroom

This project is the result of a learning exercise to consolidate fundamentals of 3D Modeling, Texturing and Lighting using Blender.

The tutorial to learn all those aspects using Blender as tool to model a Donut is [this canonic video series](https://youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD&index=2).

The following images are some renders created for the project using different lighting conditions.
